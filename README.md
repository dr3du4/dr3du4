Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm first-year telecommunications student at AGH. Networks should be my priority, but coding is more interesting.
Despite this, I am developing in cisco technologies.


I'm member of the AGH Code Industry science club. I mainly code in C ++ and Python. I have experience with frameworks such as Pygame and Kivy.
I am currently learning c #, unity and unreal engine.


I am currently working on an anti-stress app for students and pixelart RPG in a steampunk atmosphere


Besides programming, my hobbies are hitchhiking, punk and metal music, craft beers and computer games like Heroes of Might and Magic 3


Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions.
